    "# Exercise 4 - Data Science Project Preperations\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will choose a dataset, explore it using Python and pandas, and then develop your own research question(s) based on what you discover. The focus is not only on running code, but on *thinking like a data scientist*: observing patterns, noticing anomalies, and letting the data guide you toward meaningful questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will submit:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **A Jupyter Notebook**\n",
    "   containing your code, analysis steps, comments, and results.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **A short presentation**\n",
    "   summarizing your exploration, insights, and proposed research question(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "By completing this assignment you will learn to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Obtain and load real-world data\n",
    "* Perform initial data inspection and cleaning\n",
    "* Use descriptive & inferential statistics to understand the dataset\n",
    "* Visualize patterns using basic plots\n",
    "* Formulate data-driven questions for deeper analysis\n",
    "* Communicate findings clearly and concisely\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1 — Choose and Download Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Pick a dataset that interests you, from the [International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) cite](https://issp.org/), and download it.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can search [by year](https://issp.org/data-download/by-year/) or [by topic](https://issp.org/data-download/by-topic/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to also download the survey questionnaire.  \n",
    "\n",
    "> Choose something that genuinely sparks curiosity — this will make the question-forming stage meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2 — Explore the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Use pandas and visualization tools to learn about the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example exploration steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How many rows & columns? Types?\n",
    "* Missing values? Outliers?\n",
    "* Summary statistics & distributions\n",
    "* Basic inferential statistics\n",
    "* Correlations \n",
    "* Visualizations (at least 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you wish, you can also begin using scikit-learn and statsmodels for more in-depth analysis (e.g., linear and/or logistic regression).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 3 — Define Your Research Question(s)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Define **one main research question or research direction** that will guide your analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of possible research directions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *How do views of family differ across countries?*\n",
    "* *How do attitudes toward raising children differ between genders?*\n",
    "* *How does financial situation influence views on parental roles?*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Using your exploratory analysis, examine the data **in light of your chosen research direction**. Reflect on what the data reveals and consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What patterns or trends stand out?\n",
    "* Which relationships appear interesting or potentially meaningful?\n",
    "* What new hypotheses emerged during exploration?\n",
    "* If you continued this project, what would you investigate next?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this exploration, define **specific, data-driven questions** that move you closer to understanding your research goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of research question styles:\n",
    "\n",
    "* *Does X relate to Y?*\n",
    "* *Can we predict Z based on features A, B, and C?*\n",
    "* *How does category X differ from category Y?*\n",
    "* *Which variables seem to influence outcome W?*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "You do **not** need to fully answer these questions at this stage.\n",
    "The goal is to **identify promising directions for deeper analysis**, not to produce final results.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
